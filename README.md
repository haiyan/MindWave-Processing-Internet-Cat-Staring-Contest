Internet-Cat-Staring-Contest
============================

A simple staring contest game connecting the Neurosky MindWave headset with Processing.

 A simple staring contest using the Neurosky MindWave device (http://www.neurosky.com/products/mindwavemobile.aspx). The game uses the MindWave to detect
 how long the user can go without blinking, keeping a score of the number of seconds elapsed.
 
 This app uses Andreas Borg's Thinkgear library, which creates the connection with the Neurosky
 Thinkgear connector and grabs readings. The library .jar file is included, you should check if
 there have been any updated versions on his github repository (https://github.com/borg/ThinkGear-Java-socket).
 
 INSTRUCTIONS
 1. Install Thinkgear connector and make sure your MindWave works with the accompanying demos (http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=mindwavemobile)
 2. Download this repository and run MindWave_BlinkGame.pde
 3. Game should connect and start. When connection signal is good (<50) the game will start.
 4. Player will be asked to blink 3 times to start the game, this is to verify the blink detection works.
 5. Get your stare on!
